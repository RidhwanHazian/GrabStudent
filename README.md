# GrabStudent

GrabStudent is a web-based platform designed to streamline booking and feedback for students using Grab services. This project was created to explore how **Python** can be used to build web applications and is my **first project using Python** for a website. The application supports **Customers, Admins, and Drivers**.

- Customers can book rides, track statuses, and submit feedback.  
- Drivers can view available bookings, select them, update statuses, and notify customers.  
- Admins can oversee all bookings and feedback.
